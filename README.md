# India-Census-Data-Analysis
## Big Data Analysis Using Hadoop and visualizing results by R Programming

( I will keep updating this ) This is a Proposed model for Analysis of Big Data i.e. the census data set using HADOOP and also MAPREDUCE(framework), Hbase , Hive , Pig , Scoop and other tools for Data STORAGE and MANIPULATION. This will also include data analysis using R. Although I am still working to embed the R code in the java program to enable end users to generate beautiful visualizations by just one click.

# Please see this video 
to understand the project and to learn how to execute the software.

After downloading prj folder on a system with Hadoop installed ; just run these 2 commands since I've already created prj.jar :
* export HADOOP_CLASSPATH=${JAVA_HOME}/lib/tools.jar
* hadoop jar prj.jar hadoop.Login
